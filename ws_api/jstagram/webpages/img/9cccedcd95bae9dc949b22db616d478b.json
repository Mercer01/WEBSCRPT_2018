Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\n\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\n\n***\n\nFree.\nOpen source with public license (GPLv3)\nFor users by users.\n\nIf ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.\n\n***\n\nDocumentation:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin\n\nProject change log:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases\n\nContributors @ Github:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/graphs/contributors\n\nContributors @ Crowdin:\nhttps://crowdin.net/project/ublock","weeklyDownloads":221295,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Raymond Hill","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/gorhill/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157572.png?modified=1530209230","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157572.png?modified=1530209230","thumbnailWidth":267,"thumbnailHeight":200,"caption":"Default mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157576.png?modified=1530209230","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157576.png?modified=1530209230","thumbnailWidth":267,"thumbnailHeight":200,"caption":"The dashboard: stock filter lists"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157592.png?modified=1530209231","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157592.png?modified=1530209231","thumbnailWidth":267,"thumbnailHeight":200,"caption":"Dynamic filtering allows default-deny mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/159/159634.png?modified=1530209231","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/159/159634.png?modified=1530209231","thumbnailWidth":267,"thumbnailHeight":200,"caption":"The dashboard: settings"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/158/158734.png?modified=1530209232","width":700,"height":525,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/158/158734.png?modified=1530209232","thumbnailWidth":267,"thumbnailHeight":200,"caption":"Unified logger"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6185,"reviewCount":3168,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/reviews/","updateDate":1543166808000},{"id":"support@lastpass.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/8/8542-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/8/8542-64.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"LastPass Password Manager","version":"4.19.0.5","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/1133119/lastpass_password_manager-4.19.0.5-fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://lastpass.com/","supportURL":"http://forums.lastpass.com/","description":"LastPass, an award-winning password manager, saves your passwords and gives you secure access from every computer and mobile device.","fullDescription":"LastPass is a password manager that simplifies everything you do online by remembering your passwords, logging into your sites with one click, creating strong passwords for every account, and so much more.\n\nJoin over 10 million people who love getting more done every day with our award-winning password manager!\n\nWith LastPass, you only remember one master password and LastPass takes care of the rest.

Easily install custom themes from popular online repositories, or create, edit, and manage your own personalised CSS stylesheets.\n\nFeatures\n\n* Versatility of theme installation options. Stylus supports installs from popular online repositories. Additionally, styles can now also be installed from .user.css or .user.styl URLs (see Usercss format documentation in our github wiki).\n* A backup feature for your entire database of installed styles, which is compatible with other user-style managers.\n* An intuitive and configurable automatic update function for installed styles.\n* A highly customisable UI, including theming, optional layouts, icon and badge colour choices, along with many other tweaks.\n* Two different optional code validators with user configurable rules.\n\nUseful Links\n\n* Source code: https://github.com/openstyles/stylus\n* Video tutorial: https://youtu.be/fCVvGwoF5cQ\n* Chat room: https://discord.gg/tzXVNJz\n* Frequently asked questions: https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/FAQ\n* Technical bug report: https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/issues\n* General discussion and bug report: https://add0n.com/stylus.html#reviews\n* Localisation: https://www.transifex.com/github-7/Stylus/dashboard/\n\nPermissions\n\nStylus uses only a small subset of each permission. As you can see in WebExtensions API documentation or simplified tutorials, there's no way to apply any modifications to a web page without gaining the full access permission to that page. Stylus is mostly used to apply global themes, which is why it requests a global permission. In the future we might be able to implement a more granular approach but it's not exactly trivial.\n\n* Access your data for all websites - required for the style elements to be added into the page, not to access any of your data.\n* Access browser tabs - required to show styles in the popup, and for some auxiliary features like regexp tester in the editor.\n* Access browser activity during navigation - required to insert the styles at the exact moment the page is navigated to a different URL.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nUnlike other similar extensions, we don't find you all that interesting. Your questionable browsing history should remain between you and the NSA. Stylus collects nothing. Full stop.\n\nFirefox related notes\n\n* To import styles from the Stylish add-on, please read https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-export-my-user-styles-from-stylish-for-firefox-to-stylus\n* Stylus doesn't apply userstyles to the browser UI or the built-in pages like about:addons because there's no WebExtension API for dynamic application of CSS. You may use another extension that runs an externally installed companion utility to modify userChrome.css and userContent.css and restart Firefox. This restriction is imposed intentionally by Mozilla for security purposes. We don't plan to incorporate the above-mentioned workaround. See https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Styling-Firefox-UI\n* Export backups of your database frequently.
